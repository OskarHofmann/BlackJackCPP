# Blackjack
Blackjack game that can be played via the console. The game is still work in progress as I am trying to use and implement C++ features while learning C++.

Requires C++17 or newer

TODOS:
- Add rules for blackjack (two card 21)
- Add split functionality
- Add option to player several rounds
- Keep track of points over several rounds
